## 01. Information Hiding and Tell, Don't Ask

This is a typical question about infromation hiding and "Tell, Don't Ask". Nothing much to talk about.

## 02. Stack and Heap

The thing we should learn from this question is **how to declare and initialize** an **array** in Java

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```java
// Declaration
private double[] coord2D;

// Initialization
coord2D = new double[] {1，2}；
```
{% endcode %}
