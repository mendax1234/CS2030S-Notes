## Session 1

This year's Session 1 is very normal and manageable. Will update the UML if have time in the future.

### Tips

1. In the subclass of an abstract class, you still can override the concrete method in that abstract class.
2. In the Constructor of a class, always think about what are the **necessary fields** that should be included.
3. **The elegant use of** `toString()`: if your class has a string field that you want to get from outside, you can encapsulate it into `toString()` method of the class, so that calling the class itself by using either `this` or `super` will give you that string.
