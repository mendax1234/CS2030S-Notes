## Session 1

### Bus

The tricky point here is that the bus stores its passengers using **an array of** `Queue<Passenger>`, and the index of the array represents stops. For example, at stop 0, we have 1 passenger get on the bus. So, the first element in the array, which is a queue, will store this passenger. And when we move to stop 1, another passenger gets on the bus, it will be stored in the second element of the array, which is another  queue.

### BankSimulation

In [exercise-1-simulation-1.md](../../lec-rec-lab-exes/exercises/exercise-1-simulation-1.md "mention"), there is an important property for simulation, that is the `initEvents` are **sorted by time**, meaning that even though the first few events are `BusStopEvent`, the `ArrivalEvent` (Passenger Arrival) will still be processed if they happen first.

In short, we don't have to care about the sequence of the events in **simulation** thanks to the use of **priority queue**, which used the time as the key!
